### Part A

The [data](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/resource/map/2019-bottlenose-dolphin-northern-gulf-mexico-unusual-mortality-event-dead-animal) we will be exploring today are the locations of sightings of bottlenose dolphin (_Tursiops truncatus_) carcasses in the northern Gulf of Mexico. The data are provided by the _National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS)_ agency within the _National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)_. The data were collection throughout the entirety of the year 2019, within the bounding coordinates of latitude $28^{\circ}N$ to $31.75^{\circ}N$ and longitude $95^{\circ}W$ to $83.5^{\circ}W$.

### Part B

The data plotted above can be understood as a spatial point pattern as the data consists of latitude and longitude, as well as various marks included with each location. They may be interpreted as a stochastic process as the factors that may cause unusual mortality events are difficult or impossible to discern. Deceasement of bottlenose dolphins could be a naturally occurring event or it could be influenced by pollution or other ecological factors. Not only this, the locations of the sightings of the carcasses could be influenced by ocean currents. Sightings may also be influenced simply by where travelers tend to reside. The data are not regular; they appear to exhibit strong clustering by visual inspection.

### Part C

A cursory inspection of the data should immediately indicate strong evidence that the appropriate model for the data is a heterogeneous Poisson process. The data are strongly clustered along the coastline and sightings from $90^{\circ}W$ to $87.5^{\circ}W$ are typically in moderate decomposition while elsewhere, they are often in advanced decomposition. Nonetheless, we will perform a formal $\chi^2$ statistical analysis to verify our assumptions.\

#### Quadrant Test

<center>$H_0:$ The point pattern arises from a homogeneous Poisson process.</center>

<center>$H_1:$ The point pattern arises from some other stochastic mechanism.</center>

\
We use a $\chi^2$ statistical test on 40 quadrants of the study area:

```{r}
dolphins <- ppp(
  x$Lon,
  x$Lat,
  c(-94.5, -84),
  c(28.5, 31.25)
)

Q <- quadratcount(
  dolphins,
  nx = 10,
  ny = 4
)

dolphins$n / 40

plot(dolphins, main = "Bottlenose Dolphin Unusual Mortality Event Counts per Quadrant")
plot(Q, add = TRUE)

quadrat.test(
  dolphins,
  nx = 10,
  ny = 4
)
```

The actual number of points per quadrant can be seen in the quadrant plot above. Given that an unbiased estimator of $\lambda$ for a homogeneous Poisson process is

<center>$\hat{\lambda}=\tfrac{N}{|D|}$</center>\

then, we can conclude that the expected number of events per quadrant is

<center>$\hat{\lambda}|A|=8.425$</center>\

By the $\chi^2$ statistical test, we report the result of $\chi^2$ to be

<center>$\chi^2=2323.3$</center>\

and have a p-value of

<center>$p\lt2.2{\times}10^{-16}$</center>\

with $39$ degrees of freedom.\

The attained p-value is virtually zero. We reject the null hypothesis $H_0$ that the point pattern arises from a homogeneous Poisson process. This result confirms our visual interpretation of the data that pedestrian sightings of bottlenose dolphin carcasses is highly clustered.
